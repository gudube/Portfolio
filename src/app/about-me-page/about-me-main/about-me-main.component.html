				I'm currently in my final year of Software Enginnering at Polytechnique Montreal.<br>
				Although I'm still at the start of my career, I've already had the chance of working amongst multiple really talented teams at Morgan Stanley, Ubisoft and other companies.<br>
				I also had the great opportunity of studying abroad for a semester (at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden).<br>
				I'm always looking to make more contacts and make new experiences, be it software related or not.<br>
				BlaBlaBla this will change anyway.
